"""Homework 1: the remaining commerce-agent tools.

The three lecture tools (`search_help_center`, `get_order`, `issue_refund`)
are implemented in agent/agent.py and are worked examples of the pattern:
check permissions first, go through agent/db.py for data, and return a
structured dict, never a prose error. The homework tools follow the same
pattern. agent/agent.py already wraps each function below as an SDK tool, so
once a function works here it works in chat with no further wiring.

Result convention (see agent/auth.py):
  - Success: a dict with "ok": True plus the payload fields named in each
    docstring.
  - Failure: {"ok": False, "error": <code>, "reason": <human-readable str>}.

Run the contract tests with: uv run pytest tests/test_hw_holes.py -k hw1
They are marked xfail and flip to passing as you implement each function.
